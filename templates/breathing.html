            <p>Several breathing techniques could help you feel calmer and more relaxed if you’re dealing with high levels of stress. All you need is a quiet space where you can pay attention to your breathing.</p>
            <p>Out with the old, stale air and in with new fresh air. That's the theme of the two most useful breathing exercises—pursed lip breathing and belly breathing—taught by pulmonary rehabilitation specialists to individuals with chronic lung diseases such as asthma and COPD.  Like aerobic exercise improves your heart function and strengthens your muscles, breathing exercises can make your lungs more efficient.</p>

        <h2>Why Breathing Exercises Help</h2>
        <p>
            When you have healthy lungs, breathing is natural and easy. You breathe in and out with your diaphragm doing about 80 percent of the work to fill your lungs with a mixture of oxygen and other gases, and then to send the waste gas out. Lung HelpLine respiratory therapist Mark Courtney compares the process to a screen door with a spring, opening and shutting on its own. 
        </p>
        <p>
            "Our lungs are springy, like the door. Over time, though, with asthma and especially with COPD, our lungs lose that springiness. They don't return to the same level as when you start breathing, and air gets trapped in our lungs," Courtney explains.
        </p>
        <p>
            Over time, stale air builds up, leaving less room for the diaphragm to contract and bring in fresh oxygen. With the diaphragm not working to full capacity, the body starts to use other muscles in the neck, back, and chest for breathing. This translates into lower oxygen levels, and less reserve for exercise and activity.
        </p>
        <p>
            If practiced regularly, breathing exercises can help rid the lungs of accumulated stale air, increase oxygen levels, and get the diaphragm to return to its job of helping you breathe.

        <h2>How Breathing Affects Mood</h2>
        <p>
            Breathing has a significant impact on mood and overall mental well-being. Here's how it works:
        </p>
        <p>
            Slow, deep breathing regulates the nervous system by activating the parasympathetic nervous system, which promotes relaxation and reduces stress. This can help lower heart rate and blood pressure, creating a sense of calm.
        </p>
        <p>
            Proper breathing balances oxygen and carbon dioxide levels in the blood. When this balance is disrupted, it can lead to symptoms like dizziness, increased heart rate, and anxiety.
        </p>
        <p>
            Different breathing patterns influence brain activity, activating regions involved in emotion, attention, and body awareness. For example, slow, intentional breathing can reduce activity in the amygdala, a brain region associated with fear and anxiety.
        </p>
        <p>
            Mindful breathing exercises improve focus and attention by increasing oxygen flow to the brain and reducing distractions, enhancing concentration and cognitive function.
        </p>
        <p>
            By controlling your breath, you can manage emotional responses more effectively, which is particularly useful in stressful situations where rapid breathing might otherwise trigger anxiety or panic.

        <h3>For Stress</h3>
        <h4>Regular Breathing</h4>
        <p>
            Take a deep breath in. Now let it out. You may notice a difference in how you feel already. Your breath is a powerful tool to ease stress and make you feel less anxious. Some simple breathing exercises can make a big difference if you make them part of your regular routine.
        </p>
        <p>
            Before you get started, keep these tips in mind:
        </p>
        <p>
            Choose a place to do your breathing exercise. It could be in your bed, on your living room floor, or in a comfortable chair.
        </p>
        <p>
            Don't force it. This can make you feel more stressed.
        </p>
        <p>
            Try to do it at the same time once or twice a day.
        </p>
        <p>
            Wear comfortable clothes.
        </p>
        <p>
            Many breathing exercises take only a few minutes. When you have more time, you can do them for 10 minutes or more to get even greater benefits.
        </p>
    
        <h4>Deep Breathing</h4>
        <p>
            Most people take short, shallow breaths into their chest. It can make you feel anxious and zap your energy. With this technique, you'll learn how to take bigger breaths, all the way into your belly.
        </p>
        <p>
            Get comfortable. You can lie on your back in bed or on the floor with a pillow under your head and knees. Or you can sit in a chair with your shoulders, head, and neck supported against the back of the chair.
        </p>
        <p>
            Breathe in through your nose. Let your belly fill with air. Breathe out through your nose.
        </p>
        <p>
            Place one hand on your belly. Place the other hand on your chest. As you breathe in, feel your belly rise. As you breathe out, feel your belly lower. The hand on your belly should move more than the one that's on your chest.
        </p>
        <p>
            Take three more full, deep breaths. Breathe fully into your belly as it rises and falls with your breath.
        </p>
    
        <h4>Breath Focus</h4>
        <p>
            While you do deep breathing, use a picture in your mind and a word or phrase to help you feel more relaxed.
        </p>
        <p>
            Close your eyes if they're open. Take a few big, deep breaths.
        </p>
        <p>
            Breathe in. As you do that, imagine that the air is filled with a sense of peace and calm. Try to feel it throughout your body.
        </p>
        <p>
            Breathe out. While you're doing it, imagine that the air leaves with your stress and tension.
        </p>
        <p>
            Now use a word or phrase with your breath. As you breathe in, say in your mind, "I breathe in peace and calm." As you breathe out, say in your mind, "I breathe out stress and tension."
        </p>
        <p>
            Continue for 10 to 20 minutes.
        </p>

        <h3>Lack of Sleep</h3>
        
        <h4>Equal Time for Breathing In and Breathing Out</h4>
        <p>
            In this exercise, you'll match how long you breathe in with how long you breathe out. Over time, you'll increase how long you're able to breathe in and out at a time.
        </p>
        <p>
            Sit comfortably on the floor or in a chair.
        </p>
        <p>
            Breathe in through your nose. As you do it, count to five. Breathe out through your nose to the count of five.
        </p>
        <p>
            Repeat several times. Once you feel comfortable with breaths that last five counts, increase how long you breathe in and breathe out. You can work up to breaths that last up to 10 counts.
        </p>
    
        <h4>Progressive Muscle Relaxation</h4>
        <p>
            In this technique, you breathe in as you tense a muscle group and breathe out as you release it. Progressive muscle relaxation helps you relax physically and mentally.
        </p>
        <p>
            Lie comfortably on the floor. Take a few deep breaths to relax.
        </p>
        <p>
            Breathe in. Tense the muscles of your feet. Breathe out. Release the tension in your feet.
        </p>
        <p>
            Breathe in. Tense your calf muscles. Breathe out. Release the tension in your calves.
        </p>
        <p>
            Work your way up your body. Tense each muscle group. This includes your legs, belly, chest, fingers, arms, shoulders, neck, and face.
        </p>
    
        <h4>Modified Lion's Breath</h4>
        <p>
            As you do this exercise, imagine that you're a lion. Let all of your breath out with a big, open mouth.
        </p>
        <p>
            Sit comfortably on the floor or in a chair. Breathe in through your nose. Fill your belly all the way up with air.
        </p>
        <p>
            When you can't breathe in any more, open your mouth as wide as you can. Breathe out with a "HA" sound.
        </p>
        <p>
            Repeat several times.
        </p>

        <h3>For Anxiety</h3>
    
        <h4>Equal Breathing</h4>
        <p>
            Another form of breathing that stems from the ancient practice of pranayama yoga is equal breathing. This means you’re inhaling for the same amount of time as you’re exhaling.
        </p>
        <p>
            You can practice equal breathing from a sitting or lying-down position. Whichever position you choose, be sure to get comfortable.
        </p>
        <p>
            Shut your eyes and pay attention to the way you normally breathe for several breaths. Then, slowly count 1-2-3-4 as you inhale through your nose.
        </p>
        <p>
            Exhale for the same four-second count. As you inhale and exhale, be mindful of the feelings of fullness and emptiness in your lungs.
        </p>
        <p>
            As you continue practicing equal breathing, your second count might vary. Be sure to keep your inhale and exhale the same.
        </p>
    
        <h4>Resonant Breathing</h4>
        <p>
            Resonant breathing, also called coherent breathing, can help you calm anxiety and get into a relaxed state. To try it yourself:
        </p>
        <p>
            Lie down and close your eyes. Gently breathe in through your nose, mouth closed, for a count of six seconds. Don’t fill your lungs too full of air.
        </p>
        <p>
            Exhale for six seconds, allowing your breath to leave your body slowly and gently. Don’t force it.
        </p>
        <p>
            Continue for up to 10 minutes. Take a few additional minutes to be still and focus on how your body feels.
        </p>

        <h3>For Depression</h3>
    
        <h4>Triangular Breathing</h4>
        <p>
            Gently holding the breath can lift energy. There should never be any strain, so the extent of the hold will vary. You should aim to have the in-breath and out-breath the same length, with a hold in between. 
            One ratio would be to breathe in for a count of four, hold the breath for up to a count of four (as long as it is comfortable), and breathe out for a count of four. If four is too long, you can adjust it to breathe in for four, hold for two, and out for four. 
            The number of counts doesn't matter as much as maintaining a regular ratio.
        </p>
        <p>
            Do this for several rounds of breathing and finish the controlled breathing on an inhalation. Finishing on an in-breath heightens energy, which is usually helpful with depression, while finishing on an out-breath can flatten energy.
            This simple breathing technique can lift mood and help break the cycle of depressive thoughts, giving you more clarity and focus.
        </p>
    
        <h4>Armpit Breathing</h4>
        <p>
            It may sound odd, but it’s hard to feel depressed when you're exposing your armpits. Sit or stand and extend your arms down by your sides, palms facing backwards. As you breathe in, raise your arms with your breath until your arms are up and your armpits are exposed.
            Slowly lower them as you exhale. Repeat several rounds.
        </p>
        <p>
            This exercise helps to open the front of the body and has an uplifting effect. Even if you feel down, give it a try, as it can help lift your mood and bring a bit of energy into your body.
        </p>
    
        <h4>Passive Supported Resting Breath</h4>
        <p>
            If it feels too hard to do anything else, there are ways of resting that can help with depression. When people are depressed, they often slump forward, closing in their chest and reducing their breathing. 
            A simple way to rest more helpfully is to get a blanket (or two large towels) and fold it into a rectangle about 2 inches thick and at least 1 meter (3 ft) long. Place it on the floor and lie on it with your spine aligned along the blanket, one end just above your hips. 
            Your arms should rest out to your sides at about a 30-degree angle, palms facing up.
        </p>
        <p>
            This gentle position opens the chest passively. Do full breaths for several rounds and then allow your breathing to follow its natural rhythm. This relaxing posture can help lift the feeling of heaviness associated with depression.
        </p>

        <h3>For Bipolar</h3>
    
        <h4>Pear-Shaped Breath</h4>
        <p>
            Pear-shaped breath is a hands-on approach to yogic breathing that can be done while sitting, standing, or lying down:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Place one hand on your abdomen and the other on your chest.</li>
            <li>As you inhale, think of the air expanding down into your belly so that your lower hand moves gently outward.</li>
            <li>Exhale for the same count, feeling the belly sink.</li>
            <li>Do this for a minute or two, such as “the time while your tea steeps.”</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            This breathing technique helps counteract rapid chest breathing, which is often a companion to fear and anxiety.
        </p>
    
        <h4>Bhramari Breathing (Bee Breath)</h4>
        <p>
            Also known as “Bee Breath,” this technique involves a humming sound similar to a bee’s buzz, which helps center your focus inward. A simple version for beginners includes:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Plug your ears with your thumbs, letting your fingers splay across your forehead and cheeks.</li>
            <li>Keep your eyes and mouth gently closed.</li>
            <li>After inhaling deeply, breathe out while making an Om sound, focusing on the letter “M” as if you’re singing.</li>
            <li>Repeat for several rounds — about five to ten rounds, or as many as feels comfortable.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            Closing off external stimulation allows you to feel the resonating hum of Om, helping to reduce anxiety, moderate intense emotions, and calm racing thoughts.
        </p>
    
        <h4>Breath of Fire (Kapalabhati Pranayama)</h4>
        <p>
            Breath of Fire is a rapid breathing technique involving passive inhalations and forceful exhalations through the nose, paired with abdominal crunches. Here's a modified version:
        </p>
        
            <li>Stand firmly rooted to the floor and reach your arms up to the sky with palms open and fingers spread.</li>
            <li>Breathe in deeply through the nose.</li>
            <li>On the exhale, make a forceful “Ha” sound through your mouth while bringing your elbows down to your sides and fisting your hands.</li>
            <li>If reaching upward is difficult, you can reach forward on the inhale and pull back directly on the “Ha” exhale.</li>
        
        <p>
            This practice can be empowering, as the “Ha” sound helps release tension held in the physical body.
